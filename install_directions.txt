These are the install directions to get your system set up for supporting Amazon based deploys.

First make sure you have the latest version of chef.  NOTE: in the following instructions I show gem install ... you may
need to use sudo gem install ... instead if your system is set up to install gems in a system directory which is the default
if you are using the standard mac ruby configuration.

gem install chef

# Install the zzdeploy gem which gives you your zz commands
gem install zzdeploy

# install your amazon api keys with
zz config_amazon --akey AKIAJZR7WODGPXONMRVA --skey lUEwegAXc0NSSrB16klFtBWKDuFO/LLZfyZi82DR

# In order to gain access to the Amazon deployed machines via ssh you need to set up various private keys
# I am not showing the keys here but you can get them from the keychain 'ZZ Admin Accounts'.  Scroll
# about half way down until you see the text: Deploy group private keys.  Below this you will see
#amazon_staging:

Copy everything from the #amazon_staging: to the end of the file onto your clipboard.  Open up a terminal session
and paste the text you copied.  This should create all the private key files in the proper locations on your system.

At this point you should be all set up.  You can do a quick verification by running:

zz ssh -g photos_staging

If all is working you should get a list of servers, pick one and you should be logged into that machine via ssh.

# CHECKLIST FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOY

Pre-deploy steps

- Set up vhost to be hacktest.photos.zangzing.com initially to test with production data
- Set email host to be hacktest.zangzing.com
- Point database at production photos db: zz-prod-rds.ckikxby0s3p8.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- Create a production load balancer (photos-production-balancer)
- map hacktest.photos.zangzing.com to production load balancer (will change on deploy day)
-
- Create production deploy group (in us-east-1c except db_slave)
-- 1 App master
-- 2 App servers
-- 1 db master (redis master)
-- 1 db_slave  (redis slave) (create in zone us-east-1d, all others are in 1c)
-- 3 util (photo cpu workers)
-
- Install private key file to allow tunnel to EY
- Create live SSH tunnel on local port 9999 to Redis Server running at EY
- Change role of Amazon Redis master to be a slave of EY until synced
- Change role of redis back to master (for testing)
- Verify functionality for basic operations (minimize writing to production db)
-

Deploy steps
-
- Amazon machines
- stop local redis db slave
- remove local redis db, start redis master, convert to slave of EY, verify in sync
- remove hacktest.photos.zangzing.com from Route53 load balancer alias mapping
- change group configuration to use vhost of www.zangzing.com
- Set email host to be zangzing.com
- delete old group with
-- zz deploy_group_delete -g photos_production
- assign new password to zzadmin account on production db of lwoksdp87iqz
-- log into production photo db and run the following
--
- create the new group with changes
-- zz deploy_group_create --group photos_production --app_name photos --rails_env photos_production --vhost www.zangzing.com --email_host zangzing.com --app_git_url git@github.com:zangzing/server.git --amazon_security_key amazon_production --amazon_security_group security_production --amazon_image baseline_production --amazon_elb photos-production-balancer --database_host zz-prod-rds.ckikxby0s3p8.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --database_username zzadmin --database_password lwoksdp87iqz --database_schema photos_prod
-
- chef_upload and chef_bake to pick up new vhost changes
- deploy 2011-08-17-feature to pick up vhost changes
- use zz maint --maint -g photos_produciton to turn on MAINT mode
- hand verify nginx conf files to make sure host related changes look correct
-
- EY machines
- On EY environment, shut down nginx on 2 of 3 app servers to limit new incoming traffic
- Put up maint page on remaining App server
- Let system bleed work until no further work in resque queues or 5 minutes whichever is longer
-
- On Ylastic for Route53 DNS
- Remove A entries for photos.zangzing.com, www.zangzing.com, zangzing.com
- Create Alias entry for zanging.com. that points to photos-production-balancer
- Create CNAME entries for www.zangzing.com and photos.zangzing.com pointing to zangzing.com (initially use 60 sec TTL, change at later date to higher value)
-
- Amazon
- stop and restart master redis (will turn off slave of EY)
- stop and restart slave redis (will sync with new master)
- use zz maint --no-maint -g photos_produciton to turn on MAINT mode
- server should be back up
- verify server is working and account data is intact
- congratulate ourselves for a job well done!

Post deploy (a couple of days later)
- Shut down all EY servers
- send EY a Dear John letter to terminate "support agreement"
