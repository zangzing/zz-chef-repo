These are the install directions to get your system set up for supporting Amazon based deploys.

First make sure you have the latest version of chef.  NOTE: in the following instructions I show gem install ... you may
need to use sudo gem install ... instead if your system is set up to install gems in a system directory which is the default
if you are using the standard mac ruby configuration.

gem install chef

# Install the zzdeploy gem which gives you your zz commands
gem install zzdeploy

# install your amazon api keys with
zz config_amazon --akey AKIAJZR7WODGPXONMRVA --skey lUEwegAXc0NSSrB16klFtBWKDuFO/LLZfyZi82DR

# In order to gain access to the Amazon deployed machines via ssh you need to set up various private keys
# I am not showing the keys here but you can get them from the keychain 'ZZ Admin Accounts'.  Scroll
# about half way down until you see the text: Deploy group private keys.  Below this you will see
#amazon_staging:

Copy everything from the #amazon_staging: to the end of the file onto your clipboard.  Open up a terminal session
and paste the text you copied.  This should create all the private key files in the proper locations on your system.

At this point you should be all set up.  You can do a quick verification by running:

zz ssh -g photos_staging

If all is working you should get a list of servers, pick one and you should be logged into that machine via ssh.
